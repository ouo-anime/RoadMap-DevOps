### Types of Computer Networks

> **LAN** (Local Area Network) is a collection of devices connected together in one physical location, such as a building, office, or home. A LAN can be small or large, ranging from a home network with one user to an enterprise network with thousands of users and devices in an office or school. <br>

> **MAN** (Metropolitan Area Network) is a computer network that connects computers within a metropolitan area, which could be a single large city, multiple cities and towns, or any given large area with multiple buildings. A MAN is larger than a local area network (LAN) but smaller than a wide area network (WAN). MANs do not have to be in urban areas; the term "metropolitan" implies the size of the network, not the demographics of the area that it serves. <br>

> **WAN** (Wide Area Network) is a collection of local-area networks (LANs) or other networks that communicate with one another.  A WAN is essentially a network of networks, with the Internet the world's largest WAN. <br>
