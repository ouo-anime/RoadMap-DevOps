#### Main Parts of a Protocol:
> Syntax – This is the format of the data. <br>
First 8 bits are for the sender, next 8 bits for the receiver, rest is the message.

> Semantics – This tells the meaning of each part of the message. <br>
Address bits tell where the message is going.

> Timing – This tells when to send the data and how fast. <br>
Don’t send too fast if the receiver can’t keep up.
