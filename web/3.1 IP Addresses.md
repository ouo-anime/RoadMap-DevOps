<h1> IP Addresses </h1>

- IP (Internet Protocol) addresses are like digital addresses for devices. They let computers, smartphones, and other devices find and talk to each other on a network or the internet.
- Without IP addresses, activities like emailing, browsing, watching videos, or using apps wouldn’t work.
- An IP address is a unique identifier assigned to each device on a network.
- It's like your home address: just as the post office needs your home address to deliver mail, the internet needs your device’s IP address to send data.

### IPv4 – Internet Protocol Version 4
- IPv4 is the most commonly used IP address format.
- It uses 32 bits, split into 4 groups (called octets) of 8 bits each.
- Written in decimal format, separated by dots (.)

**Example:** 192.168.1.101

> Each number (192, 168, 1, 101) is the decimal version of 8 binary bits. <br> Possible values per octet: 0 to 255 <br> Total possible addresses: 2³² = ~4.3 billion addresses

### IPv6 – Internet Protocol Version 6 
- IPv6 was introduced to solve the shortage of IPv4 addresses.
- It uses 128 bits, divided into 8 groups of 16 bits each.
- Written in hexadecimal format, separated by colons (:)

**Example:** 2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334

> Leading zeros in each group can be removed:
> **2001:db8:85a3::8a2e:370:7334** (double colon :: means one or more groups of all zeros)
> Total possible addresses: 2¹²⁸ = a huge number (~340 undecillion)
