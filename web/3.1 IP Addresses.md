<h1> IP Addresses </h1>

- IP (Internet Protocol) addresses are like digital addresses for devices. They let computers, smartphones, and other devices find and talk to each other on a network or the internet.
- Without IP addresses, activities like emailing, browsing, watching videos, or using apps wouldn’t work.
- An IP address is a unique identifier assigned to each device on a network.
- It's like your home address: just as the post office needs your home address to deliver mail, the internet needs your device’s IP address to send data.

### IPv4 – Internet Protocol Version 4
- IPv4 is the most commonly used IP address format.
- It uses 32 bits, split into 4 groups (called octets) of 8 bits each.
- Written in decimal format, separated by dots (.)

**Example:** 192.168.1.101

> Each number (192, 168, 1, 101) is the decimal version of 8 binary bits. <br> Possible values per octet: 0 to 255 <br> Total possible addresses: 2³² = ~4.3 billion addresses

### IPv6 – Internet Protocol Version 6 
- IPv6 was introduced to solve the shortage of IPv4 addresses.
- It uses 128 bits, divided into 8 groups of 16 bits each.
- Written in hexadecimal format, separated by colons (:)

**Example:** 2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334

> Leading zeros in each group can be removed:

> **2001:db8:85a3::8a2e:370:7334** (double colon :: means one or more groups of all zeros)


> Total possible addresses: 2¹²⁸ = a huge number (~340 undecillion)

### Public vs. Private IP Addresses

In networking, IP addresses are divided into public and private categories. Understanding the difference between the two is essential for how devices connect within a network and to the internet.

The current IPv4 system, while foundational for internet communication, faces a significant limitation: the total number of unique IP addresses is finite—approximately 4.3 billion. Considering there are more than 7.5 billion people worldwide and countless connected devices, this number simply isn’t sufficient to provide a unique IP address for every device globally.

To address this shortage, the concept of private IP addresses was introduced. These are special ranges of IP addresses that can be used repeatedly within private local area networks (LANs), such as those in homes, schools, or businesses. Devices within the same LAN can communicate with each other using these private IPs, but these addresses are not routable on the public internet. This means they cannot be used to directly access or be accessed from the broader internet.

Private IP addresses help conserve the limited pool of IPv4 addresses by allowing the same address ranges to be reused in different local networks around the world. Common private IP address ranges include:

- 192.168.0.0 to 192.168.255.255

- 10.0.0.0 to 10.255.255.255

- 172.16.0.0 to 172.31.255.255


If you’ve ever checked the IP configuration of your device and seen an address starting with 192.168 or 10, that’s your device’s private IP address assigned within your local network.

On the other hand, public IP addresses are unique across the entire internet. These are the addresses that allow your device—or more commonly, your network’s router—to be identified and reached by other devices worldwide.

Since devices on a private network use private IP addresses, they rely on a technology called Network Address Translation (NAT) to communicate over the internet. NAT translates private IP addresses into a public IP address when sending data outside the local network and vice versa when receiving responses. This process effectively allows many devices within a LAN to share a single public IP address, making efficient use of the limited IPv4 address space.

In summary, private IP addresses serve as reusable internal identifiers within local networks, while public IP addresses provide unique identities on the global internet. Together, these two types of addresses enable the modern internet to support billions of connected devices despite the limitations of IPv4 addressing.
